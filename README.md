# üåç Air Quality Analysis ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## üìå Description

This project explores air quality data from various global cities using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. It is designed as a hands-on practice exercise to develop data intuition, clean real-world datasets, explore relationships, and communicate findings effectively.

The dataset contains pollutant concentrations (e.g., CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5) and corresponding AQI (Air Quality Index) values measured across time and locations. The focus is not on modeling but on understanding and extracting **valuable insights** from the data.

## üéØ Objectives

- Practice real-world **EDA skills** with Python and pandas
- Understand trends in air pollution across **time**, **cities**, and **pollutants**
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering (e.g., extracting seasons, hours)
- Visualize patterns and relationships in the data
- Identify key factors influencing AQI and pollution peaks

## üîç Key Insights

This EDA addressed six core analytical questions, leading to the following insights:

1. **What are the pollution levels for each pollutant?**  
   - Calculated **max**, **min**, and **mean** values for pollutants like CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5.
   - PM2.5 and CO showed wide variability, suggesting more extreme pollution events.

2. **Which cities are the most polluted?**  
   - Cities like **Dubai** exhibited the highest average AQI values.
   - Grouped data by city and pollutant to rank cities based on pollution severity.

3. **Is there a seasonal pattern in pollution levels?**  
   - Grouped data by **season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)**.
   - Found higher AQI during **summer months** in several cities ‚Äî possibly due to heat, dust, and higher energy usage.

4. **Are pollution levels higher at certain hours of the day?**  
   - Analyzed AQI by **hour of day**.
   - Pollution levels tended to rise during **early mornings and evenings**, likely due to rush-hour traffic.

5. **Are some pollutants correlated?**  
   - Generated a **correlation matrix** to analyze relationships.
   - Moderate correlation found between certain pollutants like CO and NO‚ÇÇ, suggesting shared sources (e.g., vehicle emissions).

6. **What can we learn from outliers?**  
   - Used the **IQR method** to detect extreme AQI values.
   - Outliers often corresponded to short-term pollution events, such as industrial activities or weather conditions.

## üìä Visualizations

To support the analysis, multiple visual tools were used:

- **Line plots**: AQI over hours, pollutants per city, or seasonal trends
- **Bar plots**: Average AQI across cities or seasons
- **Box plots**: Distribution and outlier detection by pollutant
- **Heatmaps**: Correlation between pollutants
- **Categorical grouping**: Hourly and seasonal grouping to highlight temporal patterns

## üß† Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** / VSCode for development
