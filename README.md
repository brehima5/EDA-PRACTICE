# üåç Air Quality Analysis ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## üìå Description

This project explores air quality data from 6 important cities using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. It is designed as a hands-on practice exercise to develop data intuition, clean real-world datasets, explore relationships, and communicate findings effectively in Github.

The dataset contains pollutant concentrations (e.g., CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5,CO2) and corresponding AQI (Air Quality Index) values measured across time and locations(Dubai, Cairo, Brazilia, London, New York, Sydney). The focus is not on modeling but on understanding and extracting **valuable insights** from the data.

## üéØ Objectives

- Practice real-world **EDA skills** with Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
- Understand trends in air pollution across **time**, **cities**, and **pollutants**
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation (e.g., extracting seasons, hours)
- Visualize patterns and relationships in the data

## üîç Key Insights

This EDA addressed six core analytical questions, leading to the following insights:

1. **What are the pollution levels for each pollutant?**  
- Calculated **max**, **min**, and **mean** values for pollutants like CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5.
- **Dubai** stands out as the most polluted city overall. It consistently records the highest average levels of key pollutants such as **carbon monoxide (CO)**, **particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)**, and has the highest average **AQI**, indicating generally poor air quality.

- **Cairo** shows exceptionally high levels of **sulfur dioxide (SO‚ÇÇ)**, both in average and maximum values. This suggests potential industrial or fossil fuel-related sources significantly affecting the air quality in the region.

- In contrast, **Sydney** and **Brasilia** exhibit the cleanest air among the cities analyzed. Both maintain **low levels of most pollutants** and have the **lowest average AQI values**, suggesting relatively healthy air conditions.

These observations provide a clear understanding of how pollution levels vary significantly across cities and can guide further investigation into sources and solution strategies.

2. **Which cities are the most polluted?**  
   - Cities like **Dubai** exhibited the highest average AQI values.
   - Grouped data by city to rank cities based on pollution severity.

3. **Is there a seasonal pattern in pollution levels?**
   - Grouped data by **season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)**.
   - Found higher AQI during **summer months** in several cities ‚Äî possibly due to heat, dust, and higher energy usage.
   - **Summer** emerges as the season with the **highest overall AQI**, suggesting poorer air quality, particularly due to elevated levels of **ozone (O‚ÇÉ)** and **particulate matter (PM10)**. These pollutants tend to increase with heat and sunlight.

   - **Fall and Winter** exhibit **slightly better air quality** overall, with **lower AQI values**, although **CO and SO‚ÇÇ levels** peak in **winter**, potentially due to heating-related emissions and stagnant air conditions.

   - **Spring** shows moderate AQI levels, but an increase in **PM2.5** and **O‚ÇÉ**, likely due to transitional weather patterns and blooming-related particulates.

This seasonal trend highlights the importance of considering **temporal variation** when analyzing air pollution and designing mitigation strategies.


4. **Are pollution levels higher at certain hours of the day?**  
   - Analyzed Pollutant by **hour of day**.
   - Pollution levels is generally simillar accross the day but it tends to slightly rise during **early mornings and evenings**, likely due to rush-hour traffic.

5. **Are some pollutants correlated?**  
   - Generated a **correlation matrix** to analyze relationships.
   - CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 are highly correlated, suggesting common sources or related atmospheric behavior.
   - PM2.5 and PM10 are almost perfectly correlated, which is expected.
   - SO2 generally shows weaker correlations with other pollutants, indicating potentially different sources or atmospheric processes.

6. **What can we learn from outliers?**  
   - Used the **IQR method** to detect extreme values and learn from it.
Outlier analysis uncovered **significant pollution spikes** that stand apart from regular trends:

   - Nearly **all extreme outliers** come from **Dubai**, indicating **severe pollution episodes**.

   - Among these, the **majority occurred during the summer season**, suggesting a seasonal intensification of pollution in Dubai, possibly due to high temperatures amplifying pollutant concentrations or increased emissions.

   - A **small cluster of 8 outliers** was also found in **Cairo**, all on **February 12, 2024, between 1 PM and 8 PM**. This isolated event may signal a **temporary environmental incident**.

## üìä Visualizations

To support the analysis, multiple visual tools were used:

- **Bar plots**: Average AQI across cities or seasons
